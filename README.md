# devsecops-api-script

## DEPRECATED

This repository is deprecated and will be replaced by a new Ansible Collection and click-based script using the same back end. The work on those is ongoing [here](https://github.com/RedHatGov/devsecops-api-collection). This repository will remain to facilitate existing projects that actively use the latest releases from here.

If you need to add functionality, you should migrate your project from this repository to the new one and PR the changes there.
